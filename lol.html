                C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

                    The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"; and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages".

            <p>C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:</p>
                    <code>
                            #include <iostream>

                                    int main()
                                    {
                                        std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
                                    }
                    </code>

            <p>
                Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C/C++ programming language is incomplete without the use of operators. We can define operators as symbols that helps us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words we can say that an operator operates the operands.

            <p>
                A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.
            </p>
            <p>The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
            </p>
            <p>
            Example: 
            Below is a simple C program to demonstrate functions in C.
            </p> 
            <code> #include <stdio.h> 

                    // An example function that takes two parameters 'x' and 'y' 
                    // as input and returns max of two input numbers 
                    int max(int x, int y) 
                    { 
                        if (x > y) 
                        return x; 
                        else
                        return y; 
                    } 
                    
                    // main function that doesn't receive any parameter and 
                    // returns integer. 
                    int main(void) 
                    { 
                        int a = 10, b = 20; 
                    
                        // Calling above function to find max of 'a' and 'b' 
                        int m = max(a, b); 
                    
                        printf("m is %d", m); 
                        return 0; 
                    }
                </code> 
                            
            
            <p>Output:</p>
            <code>
                m is 20

            <p>
                An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have small number of objects, but if we want to store large number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of array is to represent many instances in one variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                    We can declare an array by specifying its type and size or by initializing it or by both.

            <p>
                Object oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object oriented programming aims to implement real world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operates on them so that no other part of code can access this data except that function.
